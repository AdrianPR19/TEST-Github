***Development Environments***

This subject aims to provide students with a deep understanding of the environments and tools used in software development. A typical aspect that this subject covers may be, for example, IDEs

In this time that I have been teaching development environments, I have really liked the subject since we have been seeing different IDEs that can be very useful, in addition we have been seeing various tools that can be very useful in the future, generally I I'm really enjoying the subject
